We are grateful for their support, faith and\r\ntrust in our policies. We are determined to ensure that all Indians, regardless\r\nof religion, caste, gender and age, make substantial progress in realising their\r\nlife goals and aspirations.\r\nGlobal Context\r\n2.\r\nThe global economy, while performing better than expected, is still in\r\nthe grip of policy uncertainties. Elevated asset prices, political uncertainties\r\nand shipping disruptions continue to pose significant downside risks for\r\ngrowth and upside risks to inflation.\r\n3.\r\nIn this context, India’s economic growth continues to be the shining\r\nexception and will remain so in the years ahead. India’s inflation continues to\r\nbe low, stable and moving towards the 4 per cent target. Core inflation (non-\r\nfood, non-fuel) currently is 3.1 per cent. Steps are being taken to ensure\r\nsupplies of perishable goods reach market adequately.\r\n\r\n2\r\nInterim Budget\r\n4.\r\nAs mentioned in the interim budget, we need to focus on 4 major\r\ncastes, namely ‘Garib’ (Poor),\r\n‘Mahilayen’\r\n(Women),\r\n‘Yuva’ (Youth) and\r\n‘Annadata’ (Farmer). For Annadata, we announced higher Minimum Support\r\nPrices a month ago for all major crops, delivering on the promise of at least a\r\n50 per cent margin over costs. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana was\r\nextended for five years, benefitting more than 80 crore people.\r\n5.\r\nAdministrative actions for approval and implementation of various\r\nschemes announced in the interim budget are well underway. The required\r\nallocations have been made.\r\nBudget Theme\r\n6.\r\nTurning attention to the full year and beyond, in this budget, we\r\nparticularly focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class. I am\r\nhappy to announce the Prime Minister’s package of 5 schemes and initiatives\r\nto facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth\r\nover a 5-year period with a central outlay of ` 2 lakh crore. I will speak about\r\nthem shortly, while more details may be seen in the annexure. This year, I\r\nhave made a provision of ` 1.48 lakh crore for education, employment and\r\nskilling.\r\nBudget Priorities\r\n7.\r\nThe people have given a unique opportunity to our government to\r\ntake the country on the path of strong development and all-round prosperity.\r\nIn the interim budget, we promised to present a detailed roadmap for our\r\npursuit of ‘Viksit Bharat’. In line with the strategy set out in the interim\r\nbudget, this budget envisages sustained efforts on the following 9 priorities\r\nfor generating ample opportunities for all.\r\n1) Productivity and resilience in Agriculture\r\n2) Employment & Skilling\r\n3) Inclusive Human Resource Development and Social Justice\r\n4) Manufacturing & Services\r\n5) Urban Development\r\n6) Energy Security\r\n7) Infrastructure\r\n\r\n3\r\n8) Innovation, Research & Development and\r\n9) Next Generation Reforms\r\n8.\r\nSubsequent budgets will build on these, and add more priorities and\r\nactions. A more detailed formulation will be carried out as part of the\r\n‘economic policy framework’ about which I will speak later in this speech.\r\n9.\r\nThis budget details some of the specific actions to be initiated in the\r\ncurrent year towards fulfilment of these priorities with potential for\r\ntransformative changes.\r\nThe budget also covers some of the previously\r\nmade announcements with an intent to strengthen them and step up their\r\nimplementation for expediting our journey towards the goal of Viksit Bharat.\r\nPriority 1: Productivity and resilience in Agriculture\r\nTransforming agriculture research\r\n10. Our government will undertake a comprehensive review of the\r\nagriculture research setup to bring the focus on raising productivity and\r\ndeveloping climate resilient varieties. Funding will be provided in challenge\r\nmode,\r\nincluding to the private sector. Domain experts both from the\r\ngovernment and outside will oversee the conduct of such research.\r\nRelease of new varieties\r\n11. New 109 high-yielding and climate-resilient varieties of 32 field and\r\nhorticulture crops will be released for cultivation by farmers.\r\nNatural Farming\r\n12.\r\nIn the next two years, 1 crore farmers across the country will be\r\ninitiated into natural farming supported by certification and branding.\r\nImplementation will be through scientific institutions and willing gram\r\npanchayats. 10,000 need-based bio-input resource centres will be\r\nestablished.\r\nMissions for pulses and oilseeds\r\n13.\r\nFor achieving\r\nself-sufficiency in\r\npulses\r\nand oilseeds, we will\r\nstrengthen their production, storage and marketing. As announced in the\r\ninterim budget, a strategy is being put in place to achieve ‘atmanirbharta’ for\r\noil seeds such as mustard, groundnut, sesame, soybean, and sunflower.\r\n\r\n4\r\nVegetable production & Supply Chains\r\n14.\r\nLarge scale clusters for vegetable production will be developed closer\r\nto major consumption\r\ncentres. We will promote Farmer-Producer\r\nOrganizations,\r\ncooperatives and start-ups for vegetable supply chains\r\nincluding for collection, storage, and marketing.\r\nDigital Public Infrastructure for Agriculture\r\n15.\r\nBuoyed by the success of the pilot project, our government,\r\nin\r\npartnership with the states, will facilitate the implementation of the Digital\r\nPublic Infrastructure (DPI) in agriculture for coverage of farmers and their\r\nlands in 3 years. During this year, digital crop survey for Kharif using the DPI\r\nwill be taken up in 400 districts. The details of 6 crore farmers and their lands\r\nwill be brought into the farmer and land registries. Further, the issuance of\r\nJan Samarth based Kisan Credit Cards will be enabled in 5 states.\r\nShrimp Production & Export\r\n16.\r\nFinancial support for setting up a network of Nucleus Breeding\r\nCentres for Shrimp Broodstocks will be provided. Financing for shrimp\r\nfarming, processing and export will be facilitated through NABARD.\r\nNational Cooperation Policy\r\n17. Our government will bring out a National Cooperation Policy for\r\nsystematic, orderly and all-round development of the cooperative sector.\r\nFast-tracking growth of rural economy and generation of employment\r\nopportunities on a large scale will be the policy goal.\r\n18.\r\nThis year, I have made a provision of ` 1.52 lakh crore for agriculture\r\nand allied sector.\r\nPriority 2: Employment & Skilling\r\nEmployment Linked Incentive\r\n19. Our government will implement following 3 schemes for ‘Employment\r\nLinked Incentive’, as part of the Prime Minister’s package. These will be\r\nbased on enrolment in the EPFO, and focus on recognition of\r\nfirst-time\r\nemployees, and support to employees and employers.\r\n\r\n5\r\nScheme A: First Timers\r\n20.\r\nThis scheme will provide one-month wage to all persons newly\r\nentering the workforce in all formal sectors. The direct benefit transfer of\r\none-month salary in 3 instalments to first-time employees, as registered in\r\nthe EPFO, will be up to ` 15,000. The eligibility limit will be a salary of\r\n` 1 lakh per month. The scheme is expected to benefit 210 lakh youth.\r\nScheme B: Job Creation in manufacturing\r\n21.\r\nThis scheme will incentivize additional employment in the\r\nmanufacturing sector, linked to the employment of first-time employees. An\r\nincentive will be provided at specified scale directly both to the employee\r\nand the employer with respect to their EPFO contribution in the first 4 years\r\nof employment. The scheme is expected to benefit 30 lakh youth entering\r\nemployment, and their employers.\r\nScheme C: Support to employers\r\n22.\r\nThis employer-focussed scheme will cover additional employment in\r\nall sectors. All additional employment within a salary of ` 1 lakh per month\r\nwill be counted. The government will reimburse to employers up to ` 3,000\r\nper month for 2 years towards their EPFO contribution for each additional\r\nemployee. The scheme is expected to incentivize additional employment of\r\n50 lakh persons.\r\nParticipation of women in the workforce\r\n23. We will facilitate higher participation of women in the workforce\r\nthrough setting up of working women hostels in collaboration with industry,\r\nand establishing creches. In addition, the partnership will seek to organize\r\nwomen-specific skilling programmes, and promotion of market access for\r\nwomen SHG enterprises.\r\nSkilling programme\r\n24.\r\nI am happy to announce a new centrally sponsored scheme, as the 4th\r\nscheme under the Prime Minister’s package, for skilling in collaboration with\r\nstate governments and Industry. 20 lakh youth will be skilled over a 5-year\r\nperiod. 1,000 Industrial Training Institutes will be upgraded in hub and spoke\r\narrangements with outcome orientation. Course content and design will be\r\n\r\n6\r\naligned to the skill needs of industry, and new courses will be introduced for\r\nemerging needs.\r\nSkilling Loans\r\n25.\r\nThe Model Skill Loan Scheme will be revised to facilitate loans up to\r\n` 7.5 lakh with a guarantee from a government promoted Fund. This measure\r\nis expected to help 25,000 students every year.\r\nEducation Loans\r\n26.\r\nFor helping our youth who have not been eligible for any benefit\r\nunder government schemes and policies, I am happy to announce a financial\r\nsupport for loans upto ` 10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions.\r\nE-vouchers for this purpose will be given directly to 1 lakh students every\r\nyear for annual interest subvention of 3 per cent of the loan amount.\r\nPriority 3: Inclusive Human Resource Development and Social Justice\r\nSaturation approach\r\n27. Our government\r\nis committed to all-round,\r\nall-pervasive and all-\r\ninclusive development of people, particularly, farmers, youth, women and\r\npoor. For achieving social justice comprehensively, the saturation approach\r\nof covering all eligible people through various programmes including those\r\nfor education and health will be adopted to empower them by improving\r\ntheir capabilities.\r\n28.\r\nImplementation of schemes meant for supporting economic activities\r\nby craftsmen, artisans, self-help groups, scheduled caste, schedule tribe and\r\nwomen entrepreneurs, and street vendors, such as PM Vishwakarma, PM\r\nSVANidhi, National Livelihood Missions, and Stand-Up India will be stepped\r\nup.\r\nPurvodaya\r\n29.\r\nThe states in the Eastern part of the country are rich in endowments\r\nand have strong cultural traditions. We will formulate a plan, Purvodaya, for\r\nthe all-round development of the eastern region of the country covering\r\nBihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. This will cover\r\n\r\n7\r\nhuman resource development, infrastructure, and generation of economic\r\nopportunities to make the region an engine to attain Viksit Bharat.\r\n30. On the Amritsar Kolkata Industrial Corridor, we will support\r\ndevelopment of an industrial node at Gaya. This corridor will catalyze\r\nindustrial development of the eastern region. The industrial node at Gaya will\r\nalso be a good model for developing our ancient centres of cultural\r\nimportance into future centres of modern economy. This model shall\r\nshowcase “Vikas bhi Virasat bhi” in our growth trajectory.\r\n31. We will also support development of road connectivity projects,\r\nnamely (1) Patna-Purnea Expressway, (2) Buxar-Bhagalpur Expressway, (3)\r\nBodhgaya, Rajgir, Vaishali and Darbhanga spurs, and (4) additional 2-lane\r\nbridge over river Ganga at Buxar at a total cost of ` 26,000 crore. Power\r\nprojects, including setting up of a new 2400 MW power plant at Pirpainti, will\r\nbe taken up at a cost of ` 21,400 crore. New airports, medical colleges and\r\nsports infrastructure in Bihar will be constructed.\r\n32. An additional allocation to support\r\ncapital investments will be\r\nprovided. The requests of Bihar Government for external assistance from\r\nmultilateral development banks will be expedited.\r\nAndhra Pradesh Reorganization Act\r\n31\r\nAnnexure to Part – A\r\nPrime Minister’s Package for Employment and Skilling\r\nCoverage and Estimated Central Outlay\r\nEnrolment\r\nDuration\r\nExpenditure\r\nDuration\r\nYears\r\nEmployment Linked\r\nIncentive\r\nScheme A (first\r\ntimers)\r\nScheme B\r\n(bulk hiring of first\r\ntimers in\r\nmanufacturing)\r\nScheme C (job\r\ncreation)\r\nInternship Programme\r\n(Phase-1)\r\nInternship Programme\r\n(Phase-2)\r\nUpgradation of ITIs\r\nTotal\r\n*Starting from third year\r\nOutline of Schemes\r\n1.
